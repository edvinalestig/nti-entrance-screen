# nti-entrance-screen
A screen with a clock, a lunch menu and public transport departures from stops close to NTI-Gymnasiet Johanneberg.

Feel free to fork and contribute! Maybe improve the design or refactor the code, any help will be welcomed.
To be able to run it you need credentials from both västtrafik and skolmaten. If you don't have any, send me a message. When testing, the creds should be stored in creds.txt in the following format (one key per row):
```
<västtrafik key>
<västtrafik secret>
<skolmaten client ident>
<skolmaten client version>
```
